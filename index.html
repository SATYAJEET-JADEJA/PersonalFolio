        <p>
          I am Satyajeetsinh Jadeja, holding a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Sardar Vallabhbhai
          National Institute of Technology in India. Subsequently, I seized an excellent career opportunity as a
          Research and Development Testing Engineer at the European company HILTI. During my year-long tenure, my
          enthusiasm grew towards power electronics and the miniaturization of power electronic devices, leading me to
          delve into the world of semiconductors. Consequently, I resolved to pursue a Master's degree at the University
          at Buffalo, specializing in electrical and electronics engineering with a focus on solid-state
          electronics.<br /><br />
          My Master's program provided me with an in-depth understanding of semiconductor chips, unravelling the
          underlying physics governing their operation, diverse semiconductor chip fabrication techniques, and their
          contemporary applications in the realm of electronics.<br /><br />
          Additionally, I had the privilege of applying the skills I acquired during my university studies to real-world
          scenarios while working as a Systems Engineer Intern at Texas Instruments, specifically in the current sensing
          team. My roles encompassed working in the domains of power electronics, semiconductor device analysis, sensor
          fabrication, and their practical applications. Moreover, I gained valuable managerial experience in my
          capacity as a Systems Engineer.

            <div class="row">
              In the Spring of 2022, I collaborated with Dr. Huamin Li within his research group, focusing on
              "Field-effect Raman Spectroscopic Investigation on Two-Dimensional MoS2." Engaging in various projects
              alongside fellow research group members proved to be an exceptional highlight of my Master's program,
              serving as a profound source of motivation to intensify my pursuit of knowledge in semiconductor physics.
              Throughout the entire duration of the Individual Problem Course, my responsibilities encompassed
              conducting experiments, preparing group presentations, and delivering these presentations during weekly
              meetings with fellow members of the research group. Under the guidance of Dr. Huamin Li, a nurturing
              educational environment was cultivated, fostering mutual learning through the exchange of research
              insights and experiences.<br /><br />
              In the new world of emerging technology semiconductor plays an important role. Two-dimensional (2D)
              materials are the new to go around of Moore’s law, and MoS2 has been considered one of the most promising
              channel materials due to its superior semiconductor properties compared to conventional Si at nanometre
              scales. In this work, we exploit an electric-field Raman scanning spectroscopy to investigate
              electro-optical effects on MoS2. By applying either in-plane or out-of-plane electric fields, the
              vibration modes can be revealed and manipulated. Such electrical-optical integrated characterization will
              generate a new degree of freedom to understand the phonon dynamics in 2D materials, paving a way toward
              the realization of novel nanoelectronics based on 2D materials. <br /><br />

              As illustrated in the accompanying figure, I undertook the task of fabricating multiple transistors using
              MoS2 material. My objective was to conduct a comprehensive array of tests and gather extensive data to
              elucidate how the material's properties evolve and how we can harness these transformations to our
              advantage.<br /><br />

            <div class="row">
              The Microelectronic Device Fabrication course has played an indispensable role in reinforcing my
              commitment to the semiconductor industry. The insights gleaned from this course significantly bolstered my
              performance in job interviews. Throughout this lab-intensive course, I garnered a profound understanding
              of the principles governing cleanroom operations, along with comprehensive knowledge of the myriad
              equipment typically employed in such controlled environments. Much of this equipment serves as the most
              important part for fabricating both traditional semiconductor devices (e.g., LEDs, lasers, transistors,
              solar cells) and emerging nanotechnologies and microdevices (e.g., MEMS, nanowires,
              metamaterials).<br /><br />
              The practical laboratory activities encompassed various facets, including photolithography, metal
              deposition, operation of cleanroom apparatus, and utilization of testing equipment. Moreover, I engaged in
              four distinct projects during this course. The initial project entailed the meticulous reproduction of the
              first transistor within a cleanroom setting, thereby necessitating the application of diverse fabrication
              techniques, including wafer preparation, wet etching, and doping, to gain comprehensive insight into each
              phase of the process. <br /><br />Subsequently, the second, third, and fourth projects centred around the
              fabrication of solar cells,
              photodetectors, and MOSFETs within the confines of a cleanroom, employing a gamut of techniques ranging
              from wafer preparation, wet etching, and doping to atomic layer deposition (ALD), electron beam
              lithography (EBL), metal deposition, and wet/dry etching, with the aim of acquiring comprehensive
              proficiency in these various procedures. <br /><br />

              The course fostered an interactive and collaborative learning environment, where constructive discussions
              with fellow groups facilitated the exchange of ideas and the exploration of diverse approaches to solving
              common problems. It was within this framework that we delved into the intricate processes underlying the
              creation of integrated chips. Our educational journey commenced with an exploration of silicon wafer
              manufacturing processes, contamination control measures, photolithography techniques, and intricate
              patterning methods. This holistic approach provided us with an end-to-end comprehension of semiconductor
              chip fabrication, culminating in a profound educational experience that was both enriching and

            <h4 class="brown-text light">EE 541LEC Special Topics Course Topic: Solid State Sensors</h4>
            <div class="row">
              My inherent fascination has always been with semiconductor devices and their multifarious applications,
              with sensors representing one of the paramount and pivotal applications of semiconductor devices. The
              course in Solid-State Sensors provided an extensive exploration of electronic sensors, encompassing their
              operational principles, diverse applications, and the intricacies of sensor fabrication within a cleanroom
              environment. Electronic sensors play an integral role in an array of applications, spanning from
              rudimentary temperature sensing to the orchestration of highly automated systems. In this course I learned
              about the semiconductor fabrications, characterization and its applications across various categories of
              solid-state sensors, including acoustic, mechanical, electrical, magnetic, radiation, thermal, chemical,
              and biological sensors. The core focus of this course was to learn about sensor fabrication processes and
              the fundamental principles underpinning their operation<br /><br />
              Furthermore, during this course, I was given an opportunity to take up a topic of my choice and do
              literature review of that topic. I conducted a comprehensive review of recent scholarly literature
              pertaining to Piezoelectric Pressure sensors. These endeavours facilitated my understanding of the
              operational principles of these pressure sensors, delving even into their functioning at the nano scale.
              As illustrated in the accompanying figure, a piezoelectric semiconductor has the capability to generate
              remnant polarization at its surface or interface with other materials when subjected to mechanical strain
              due to the direct piezoelectric effect. This phenomenon, coupled with the insufficient screening of
              polarization by free charges, induces a redistribution of free charge carriers and modulates the band
              structures in proximity to the interface. This, in turn, enables the manipulation of electronic transport
              across the interface through dynamic mechanical inputs. This phenomenon is formally known as the
              "piezotronics effect," delineating the profound connection between piezoelectricity and electrical
              transport within piezoelectric semiconductors.<br />
              <img src="./assets/img/1.1.png" alt="" style="margin-left: 9%;"><br /><br />
              In addition, I had the privilege of gaining insights into the intricate fabrication process of
              Piezoelectric Pressure sensors, as elucidated in the following figure. This process entails a sequence of
              steps, each involving specialized machinery and techniques, such as wafer preparation, wet etching,
              doping, atomic layer deposition (ALD), electron beam lithography (EBL), metal deposition, wet/dry etching,
              sputtering, photolithography, spin coating, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), dry
              transfer, wet transfer, and more.<br /><br />
              <img src="./assets/img/1.3.png" alt="" style="margin-left: 10%;"><br /><br />
              My knowledge was further enriched by a comprehensive exploration of the diverse applications of these
              sensors, their deployment scenarios, market trends, and the anticipated growth trajectory in this
              domain.<br /><br />
              <img src="./assets/img/1.4.png" alt="" style="margin-left: 9%;"><br /><br />
              Upon completion of this course, I not only acquired a profound comprehension of the working principles and
              applications of solid-state sensors but also developed a profound interest in the semiconductor
              manufacturing industry. Semiconductors constitute the fundamental building blocks of virtually every
              electronic device, amplifying my fascination with this industry. I wholeheartedly recommend this course to
              fellow electrical engineering students, and I would eagerly undertake it again. The realm of sensors
              offers an abundance of opportunities for learning and practical application, making it an immensely
              rewarding educational experience. For students aspiring to specialize in the field of solid-state
              electronics, this course is not only beneficial but also adds significant value to their curriculum vitae.
